### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I am Pascal,

an experienced software engineer with a passion for building robust solutions and seamless user experiences. My toolkit includes Java â˜•, TypeScript, Dart & Flutter, and I'm an expert in Angular, focusing on developing dynamic, scalable web applications. In addition to my core languages, I have extensive experience in integration and automation, streamlining workflows and improving system efficiency with cutting-edge technologies.

ðŸ’¬ If you have any questions about Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Flutter or Angular, please feel free to contact me. I am always willing to share knowledge and collaborate on innovative projects.

ðŸ˜„ When I'm not programming, I enjoy the thrill of sailing, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen or strumming my guitar to relax.
